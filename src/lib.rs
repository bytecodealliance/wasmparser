//! A simple event-driven library for parsing WebAssembly binary files
//! (or streams).
//!
//! The parser library reports events as they happend and only stores
//! parsing information for a brief period of time, making it very fast
//! and memory-efficient. The event-driven model, however, has some drawbacks.
//! If you need random access to the entire WebAssembly data-structure,
//! this is not the right library for you. You could however, build such
//! a data-structure using this library.
